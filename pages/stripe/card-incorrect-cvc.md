## Example

What probe [`af:stripe:probe:card-incorrect-cvc`](../../probes/stripe/card-incorrect-cvc.yaml) sends (sandbox) and what it checks in the answer; the real key is elided.

```http
POST https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_intents
Authorization: Bearer <key>
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

amount=1000&currency=usd&payment_method=pm_card_chargeDeclinedIncorrectCvc&confirm=true&automatic_payment_methods[enabled]=true&automatic_payment_methods[allow_redirects]=never
```

Response (only what the probe asserts; other fields omitted):

```http

{
  "error": {
    "type": "card_error",
    "code": "incorrect_cvc",
    "decline_code": "incorrect_cvc",

    "message": "Your card's security code is incorrect.",
    "param": "cvc"
  }
}
```
