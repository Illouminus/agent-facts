## What to do

1. No client-side fix known (by design).

## Example

What probe [`af:stripe:probe:card-expired`](../../probes/stripe/card-expired.yaml) sends (sandbox) and what it checks in the answer; the real key is elided.

```http
POST https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_intents
Authorization: Bearer <key>
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

amount=1000&currency=usd&payment_method=pm_card_chargeDeclinedExpiredCard&confirm=true&automatic_payment_methods[enabled]=true&automatic_payment_methods[allow_redirects]=never
```

Response (only what the probe asserts; other fields omitted):

```http
HTTP 402

{
  "error": {
    "type": "card_error",
    "code": "expired_card",
    "decline_code": "expired_card",
    "advice_code": "confirm_card_data",
    "message": "Your card has expired.",
    "param": "exp_month"
  }
}
```
