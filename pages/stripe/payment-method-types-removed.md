# ``The `payment_method_types` parameter is no longer supported. Payment methods are now managed from your Dashboard settings (https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods). For migration guidance, see https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/dynamic-payment-methods.``

**Stripe API · POST /v1/payment_intents · HTTP 400**

Status: ✅ verified:server:sandbox · first seen 2026-10-24 · last confirmed 2026-10-30 · 16 confirmations from 2 vantages

> On API version 2026-09-30.endive, creating a PaymentIntent with payment_method_types returns HTTP 400 (no error code, parameter no longer supported); the same request on version 2024-06-20 succeeds.

## What to do

1. Omit body parameter payment_method_types.

## Example

What probe [`af:stripe:probe:payment-method-types-removed`](../../probes/stripe/payment-method-types-removed.yaml) sends (sandbox) and what it checks in the answer; the real key is elided.

```http
POST https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_intents
Authorization: Bearer <key>
Stripe-Version: 2026-09-30.endive
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

amount=100&currency=usd&payment_method_types[0]=card
```

Response (only what the probe asserts; other fields omitted):

```http
HTTP 400
Stripe-Version: 2026-09-30.endive

{
  "error": {
    "type": "invalid_request_error",
    "message": "The `payment_method_types` parameter is no longer supported. Payment methods are now managed from your Dashboard settings (https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods). For migration guidance, see https://docs.stripe.com/payments/payment-methods/dynamic-payment-methods."
  }
}
```

## In your code

When an SDK receives this response:

| SDK | Raises | Check |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Python `stripe` | `stripe.InvalidRequestError` | `e.http_status == 400` |
| Node `stripe` | `Stripe.errors.StripeInvalidRequestError` | `err.statusCode === 400` |

Read from the SDK source: stripe 16.1.0: stripe/\_api_requestor.py specific_v1_api_error, stripe/\_error.py; stripe 23.1.0: cjs/Error.js generateV1Error, cjs/RequestSender.js.

Fix 1:

```python
body.pop("payment_method_types", None)
```
