# `Amount must convert to at least 50 cents. $0.10 converts to approximately €0.09.`

**Stripe API · POST /v1/payment_intents · HTTP 400 `amount_too_small`**

Status: ✅ verified:server:sandbox · first seen 2026-10-24 · last confirmed 2026-10-30 · 16 confirmations from 2 vantages

> A 400 returned after the endpoint began executing, such as amount_too_small, is saved under its Idempotency-Key: a retry with the same key returns the same error with Idempotent-Replayed: true.

## What to do

1. Send header Idempotency-Key = new UUID per distinct request.

## Example

What probe [`af:stripe:probe:replayed-execution-error`](../../probes/stripe/replayed-execution-error.yaml) sends (sandbox) and what it checks in the answer; the real key is elided.

Step 1 → HTTP 400:

```http
POST https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_intents
Authorization: Bearer <key>
Idempotency-Key: <run_uuid>
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

amount=10&currency=usd
```

Step 2 → HTTP 400:

```http
POST https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_intents
Authorization: Bearer <key>
Idempotency-Key: <run_uuid>
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

amount=10&currency=usd
```

Response (only what the probe asserts; other fields omitted):

```http
HTTP 400
Idempotent-Replayed: true

{
  "error": {
    "code": "amount_too_small"
  }
}
```

## In your code

When an SDK receives this response:

| SDK | Raises | Check |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Python `stripe` | `stripe.InvalidRequestError` | `e.http_status == 400` · `e.code == "amount_too_small"` |
| Node `stripe` | `Stripe.errors.StripeInvalidRequestError` | `err.statusCode === 400` · `err.code === "amount_too_small"` |

Read from the SDK source: stripe 16.1.0: stripe/\_api_requestor.py specific_v1_api_error, stripe/\_error.py; stripe 23.1.0: cjs/Error.js generateV1Error, cjs/RequestSender.js.

Fix 1:

```python
import uuid
headers["Idempotency-Key"] = str(uuid.uuid4())  # a new value per distinct request; reuse it only to retry
```
