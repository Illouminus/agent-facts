# `Received unknown parameter: agent_facts_unknown`

**Stripe API · POST /v1/customers · HTTP 400 `parameter_unknown`**

Status: ✅ verified:server:sandbox · first seen 2026-10-24 · last confirmed 2026-10-31 · 23 confirmations from 2 vantages

> A 400 for a parameter that fails validation, such as parameter_unknown, is not saved under its Idempotency-Key: a retry with the same key is executed again and has no Idempotent-Replayed header.

## What to do

1. No client-side fix known (by design).

## Example

What probe [`af:stripe:probe:validation-error-not-replayed`](../../probes/stripe/validation-error-not-replayed.yaml) sends (sandbox) and what it checks in the answer; the real key is elided.

Step 1 → HTTP 400:

```http
POST https://api.stripe.com/v1/customers
Authorization: Bearer <key>
Idempotency-Key: <run_uuid>
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

agent_facts_unknown=1
```

Step 2 → HTTP 400:

```http
POST https://api.stripe.com/v1/customers
Authorization: Bearer <key>
Idempotency-Key: <run_uuid>
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

agent_facts_unknown=1
```

Response (only what the probe asserts; other fields omitted):

```http
HTTP 400

{
  "error": {
    "code": "parameter_unknown"
  }
}
```

## In your code

When an SDK receives this response:

| SDK | Raises | Check |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Python `stripe` | `stripe.InvalidRequestError` | `e.http_status == 400` · `e.code == "parameter_unknown"` |
| Node `stripe` | `Stripe.errors.StripeInvalidRequestError` | `err.statusCode === 400` · `err.code === "parameter_unknown"` |

Read from the SDK source: stripe 16.1.0: stripe/\_api_requestor.py specific_v1_api_error, stripe/\_error.py; stripe 23.1.0: cjs/Error.js generateV1Error, cjs/RequestSender.js.
