> A PaymentIntent with amount 10 and currency usd (10 cents) returns HTTP 400 amount_too_small: the amount must convert to at least 50 cents; on a test account settling in EUR the message also gives the converted amount (€0.09).

## What to do

1. No client-side fix known (by design).

## Example

What probe [`af:stripe:probe:amount-too-small`](../../probes/stripe/amount-too-small.yaml) sends (sandbox) and what it checks in the answer; the real key is elided.

```http
POST https://api.stripe.com/v1/payment_intents
Authorization: Bearer <key>
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

amount=10&currency=usd
```

Response (only what the probe asserts; other fields omitted):

```http
HTTP 400

{
  "error": {
    "type": "invalid_request_error",
    "code": "amount_too_small",
    "message": "Amount must convert to at least 50 cents. $0.10 converts to approximately €0.09."
  }
}
```
