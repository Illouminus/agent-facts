## What to do

1. No client-side fix known (by design).

## Example

What probe [`af:stripe:probe:deleted-customer`](../../probes/stripe/deleted-customer.yaml) sends (sandbox) and what it checks in the answer; the real key is elided.

Step 1:

```http
POST https://api.stripe.com/v1/customers
Authorization: Bearer <key>
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

description=agent-facts+probe
```

Step 2 → HTTP 200:

```http
DELETE https://api.stripe.com/v1/customers/<step[1].json.id>
Authorization: Bearer <key>
```

Step 3 → HTTP 200:

```http
GET https://api.stripe.com/v1/customers/<step[1].json.id>
Authorization: Bearer <key>
```

Response (only what the probe asserts; other fields omitted):

```http
HTTP 200

{
  "deleted": true,
  "object": "customer"
}
```
