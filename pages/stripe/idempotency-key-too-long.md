> An Idempotency-Key longer than 255 characters returns HTTP 400 idempotency_error; the message gives the accepted range, 1-255 characters.

## What to do

1. Send header Idempotency-Key = new UUID per distinct request.

## Example

What probe [`af:stripe:probe:idempotency-key-too-long`](../../probes/stripe/idempotency-key-too-long.yaml) sends (sandbox) and what it checks in the answer; the real key is elided.

```http
POST https://api.stripe.com/v1/customers
Authorization: Bearer <key>
Idempotency-Key: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

description=agent-facts+probe
```

Response (only what the probe asserts; other fields omitted):

```http
HTTP 400

{
  "error": {
    "type": "idempotency_error",
    "message": "Idempotent key length is 256 characters long, which is outside accepted lengths. Idempotent Keys must be 1-255 characters long. If you're looking for a decent generator, try using a UUID defined by IETF RFC 4122."
  }
}
```

## In your code

When an SDK receives this response:

| SDK | Raises | Check |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Python `stripe` | `stripe.IdempotencyError` | `e.http_status == 400` · `e.error.type == "idempotency_error"` |
| Node `stripe` | `Stripe.errors.StripeIdempotencyError` | `err.statusCode === 400` · `err.rawType === "idempotency_error"` |

Read from the SDK source: stripe 16.1.0: stripe/\_api_requestor.py specific_v1_api_error, stripe/\_error.py; stripe 23.1.0: cjs/Error.js generateV1Error, cjs/RequestSender.js.

Fix 1:

```python
import uuid
headers["Idempotency-Key"] = str(uuid.uuid4())  # a new value per distinct request; reuse it only to retry
```
