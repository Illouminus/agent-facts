## Example

What probe [`af:salesforce:probe:versions-without-session`](../../probes/salesforce/versions-without-session.yaml) sends (sandbox) and what it checks in the answer; the real key is elided.

Step 1 → HTTP 200:

```http
GET https://<org>.my.salesforce.com/services/data/v62.0/limits
Authorization: Bearer <access token>
```

Step 2 → HTTP 200:

```http
GET https://login.salesforce.com/services/data
```

Response (only what the probe asserts; other fields omitted):

```http
HTTP 200

[
  {
    "version": "…",
    "url": "…"
  }
]
```
