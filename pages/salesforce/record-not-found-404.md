## What to do

1. No client-side fix known (by design).

## Example

What probe [`af:salesforce:probe:record-not-found`](../../probes/salesforce/record-not-found.yaml) sends (sandbox) and what it checks in the answer; the real key is elided.

```http
GET https://<org>.my.salesforce.com/services/data/v62.0/sobjects/Account/001000000000000AAA
Authorization: Bearer <access token>
```

Response (only what the probe asserts; other fields omitted):

```http
HTTP 404

[
  {
    "errorCode": "NOT_FOUND",
    "message": "The requested resource does not exist"
  }
]
```
