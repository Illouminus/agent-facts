## What to do

1. No client-side fix known (by design).

## Example

What probe [`af:salesforce:probe:soql-unknown-object`](../../probes/salesforce/soql-unknown-object.yaml) sends (sandbox) and what it checks in the answer; the real key is elided.

```http
GET https://<org>.my.salesforce.com/services/data/v62.0/query?q=SELECT+Id+FROM+NoSuchObject__c
Authorization: Bearer <access token>
```

Response (only what the probe asserts; other fields omitted):

```http
HTTP 400

[
  {
    "errorCode": "INVALID_TYPE",
    "message": "SELECT Id FROM NoSuchObject__c ^ ERROR at Row:1:Column:16 sObject type 'NoSuchObject__c' is not supported. If you are attempting to use a custom object, be sure to append the '__c' after the entity name. Please reference your WSDL or the describe call for the appropriate names."
