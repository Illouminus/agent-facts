# Anonymous calls to the search endpoints count against a separate search resource with x-ratelimit-limit 10 (documented as 10 requests per minute), not against core.

**GitHub REST API · GET /search/repositories**

Status: ✅ verified:server:prod · first seen 2026-10-20 · last confirmed 2026-10-31 · 172 confirmations from 2 vantages

## What to do

1. Retry with exponential backoff from 6000 ms × 2, cap 60000 ms, ≤ 5 attempts, with jitter.

## Example

What probe [`af:github:probe:search-query-too-long`](../../probes/github/search-query-too-long.yaml) sends (prod) and what it checks in the answer.

```http
GET https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
```

Response (only what the probe asserts; other fields omitted):

```http
HTTP 422
X-RateLimit-Resource: search
X-RateLimit-Limit: 10

{
  "message": "Validation Failed",
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "The search is longer than 256 characters.",
      "field": "q",
      "code": "invalid"
    }
  ],
  "status": "422"
}
```

## In your code

Fix 1:

```python
import random
import time

delay_ms = 6000
for attempt in range(5):
    response = client.send(request)
    if response.is_success:
        break
    time.sleep(random.uniform(0, delay_ms) / 1000)
    delay_ms = min(delay_ms * 2, 60000)
```
