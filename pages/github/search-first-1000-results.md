## What to do

1. No client-side fix known (by design).

## Example

What probe [`af:github:probe:search-beyond-1000`](../../probes/github/search-beyond-1000.yaml) sends (prod) and what it checks in the answer.

```http
GET https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=stars:>1&per_page=100&page=11
```

Response (only what the probe asserts; other fields omitted):

```http
HTTP 422

{
  "message": "Only the first 1000 search results are available"
}
```

## In your code

When an SDK receives this response:

| SDK | Raises | Check |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Python `PyGithub` (community) | `github.GithubException` | `e.status == 422` |
| Node `@octokit/request` | `RequestError` | `err.status === 422` |
