> GET /repos/{owner}/{repo} on a renamed or transferred repository returns HTTP 301 Moved Permanently with Location /repositories/{id} instead of the repository object.

## What to do

1. Call GET /repositories/{id} instead.

## Example

What probe [`af:github:probe:repo-renamed`](../../probes/github/repo-renamed.yaml) sends (prod) and what it checks in the answer.

```http
GET https://api.github.com/repos/twitter/bootstrap
```

Response (only what the probe asserts; other fields omitted):

```http
HTTP 301
Location: https://api.github.com/repositories/2126244

{
  "message": "Moved Permanently"
}
```

## In your code

Fix 1:

```python
response = client.request("GET", f"/repositories/{id}")
```
