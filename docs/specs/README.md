# Specs (v0.1, 2026-10-20)

Design contracts for the first build. English on purpose: the repository will be public and read by
agents and contributors worldwide; the internal history (plan, decisions, panels) stays in Russian.

| # | File | What it fixes |
|---|------|---------------|
| 00 | [00-architecture.md](00-architecture.md) | Components, repo layout, stack, data flow, invariants |

| 02 | [02-fix-vocabulary.md](02-fix-vocabulary.md) | Closed enumeration of typed fixes (no free text, no shell) |
| 03 | [03-check-contract.md](03-check-contract.md) | `POST /v0/check`: request = contribution; default-deny ingestion |
| 04 | [04-probe-runner.md](04-probe-runner.md) | Declarative probes, vantage points, budgets, key injection, kill switch |

Conventions: every spec states **Done when** up front; numbers that are design parameters are listed in
one table per spec so they can be tuned without rewriting prose; anything a human must do is marked
`[tap]`. Decisions these specs implement: `../decisions.md` (2026-10-17 … 2026-10-20).
